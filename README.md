## Organization

  The two assemblies are listed in the main directory. The difference between these two is explored a bit later in the README. From there I split the non-gravity boom parts into three distinct designations: [Chassis](/Chassis), [Radio Components](/Radio%20Components), and [Other Electronics](/Electronic%20Subsystems). Within Chassis the three folders, [Original Files](/Original%Files), [Edited](/Edited), and [Modified Assembly](/Modified%20Assembly). [Original Files](/Original%Files) contains the original part files recieved from manufacturers. [Edited](/Edited) contains part files that have been modified to more accurately reflect how they will be cut/appear in the final CubeSat. [Modified Assembly](/Modified%20Assembly) has futher modified parts that are used in the modified assembly.
